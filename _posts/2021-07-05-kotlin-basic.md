<h1>Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers Lesson 1-3</h1> 

This article is a short summary that I newly learned on July 5, 2021 (actually dawn of July 6th)

Hello kotlin!
```kotlin
fun main() {	
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
```
Code above is a simple function that prints "Hello, Kotlin!" as an output.
I learned Kotlin with various demo in [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-welcome#0) 
I'll cover lesson 1 through lesson 3.

<h3>Lesson 1: Get started</h3>

In this lesson, we learn about the language **Kotlin** and install environment for the Kotlin.


**Kotlin** is focused on clarity, conciseness, and code safety.<br>
It has special property that you can use **Kotlin** with java. (e.g calling Java libraries in Kotlin)

The course suggest me to use intelliJ IDEA, but I used andriod studio's Kotlin REPL for codelab.

You can use **Tool > Kotlin > Kotlin REPL** to execute Kotlin REPL in your andriod studio.

<h3>Lesson 2: Kotlin basics</h3>

<h4>2.0 Operators and types</h4>

For more readability, you can use _ (underscore) in number

```kotlin
val oneMillion = 1_000_000 // Ok
val socialSecurityNumber = 999_99_9999L // Ok
val hexBytes = 0xFF_EC_DE_5E // Ok
val bytes = 0b11010010_01101001 // Ok
val SomeVersion = 1_01_013_0102 // Ok
``` 

You can use var and val for declaring variable.

**var** is for changable (mutable) variables.<br>
**val** is for unchangable (immutabl) variables, like constant.

```kotlin
var fish = 1
fish = 2 // Ok
val aquarium = 1
aquarium = 2 // error : val cannot be reassigned
```

You can use " and ' for making String in **Kotlin**. <br> 
You can replace a variable's value in some Strings with ```$ variable``` <br>
You can concatenate strings with ```+``` operation. <br>

```kotlin
val numOfFish = 5
val numOfPlants = 12
"I have $numOfFish fish" + " and $numOfPlants plants"
// --> res: kotlin.String = I have 5 fish and 12 plants
```

<h4>2.1 Compare Conditions and Booleans</h4>

Like other programming language, **Kotlin** has booleans and boolean operators like ```<```, ```==```, ```>```, ```!=```, ```<=```, ```>=```.

You can use ```in``` for ranged comparison. 

```kotlin
val number = 5

if (number in 1..10) {
    println("number is in range 1 to 10!")
} else {
    println("number is not in range 1 to 10!")
}

// --> number is in range 1 to 10!
``` 

You can use ```when``` instead writing series of ```if```, ```else if```, ```else```. 

```kotlin 
val numberOfFish = 20

if (numberOfFish == 0) {
    println("Empty tank")
} else if (numberOfFish < 40) {
    println("Got fish!")
} else {
    println("That's a lot of fish")
}

// The same as above

when (numberOfFish) {
    0 -> println("Empty tank")
    in 1..39 -> println("Got fish!")
    else -> println("That's a lot of fish")
}
```

<h4>2.2 Learn about nullability</h4> 

In **Kotlin**, there's non-nullable variables and nullable variables. <br> 
Literally, non-nullable variables can't be null. They make error when they are null. <br>
By default, variables are non-nullable. <br> 

```kotlin
var rocks: Int = null
// error: null can not be a value of a non-null type Int
``` 

When we add question mark operator ```?```, the variable can be null.

```kotlin
var marbles: Int? = null // Ok
``` 

You can test for ```null``` with ```?``` operator. 

```kotlin
var fishFoodTreats = 6

/* A */
if (fishFoodTreats != null) {
    fishFoodTreats = fishFoodTreats.dec() // decrease function. It returns var - 1
}

/* B */
fishFoodTreats = fishFoodTreats?.dec()
 
// Result of A and B is the same.
// For B, fishFoodTreats becomes null when itself is null.
``` 

You can use ```?:``` operator instead ```if```, ```else if``` in this case. 

```kotlin 
var fishFoodTreats = 6

/* A */
if (fishFoodTreats != null) {
    fishFoodTreats = fishFoodTreats.dec()
} else {
    fishFoodTreats = 0
}

/* B */
fishFoodTreats = fishFoodTreats?.dec() ?: 0

``` 

When you need to make ```NullPointerExceptions``` you can use ```!!``` operator.

```kotlin
val len = s!!.length

// throws NullPointerExceptions is s is null
```
